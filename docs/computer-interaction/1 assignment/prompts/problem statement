ok so our team messed up a little and only now did we realize that we dont actually need to have some kind of interfaces for users or make users involved into business operations. rather everything is done by employees. so we need to mainly change the intro and say that the manual tracking of orders/services on papers and inventory tracking, payment tracking, tax tracking and etc is a burden to do on paper, difficult to track etc. so what i think we do is we update that litle intro paragraph as right now it is wrong, we will not give users any way to interact through UI. i think the for employees bullet point is still standing strong, the one for customers should be more specific and say that it simply makes customerns wait more, their appointments or orders are more likely to be lost or whatever and that the ordering or service appointing takes longer as employes have to write on paper and handle paper cards etc insteado f using digital system with jjust a few button presses, etc.
the one for business owners is also standing just as strong, maybe it needs to be a little bit also more specific about the tax managment etc. but it doesnt need a lot of changes, just add that tax managment is a lso difficult.

the why this matter now is ocmpletely wrong now, it needs to be more specific on the employee, business part saying that the current paper, notes system is quite slow duo to all the friction it creates etc. and so business limit their profit. the techical barriers is jsut good. consquences of inaction also need updating, we do not have tech savy users as we do not serve through internet, we jsut make employee, business ppl job easier.

LASTLY;

keep this in mind:
1. always try to argue why is sth the way it is. just like it is in the current document, we state what is wrong and WHY it is wrong.
2. do not use a complex vocabulary, follow the current style of the text.
3. keep the general structure of the document
4. do not edit a lot the parts that i said are mostly okay


Why this matters and consquences of inaction feel very similar, i would say that maybe we should put them one near other and then in the why this matter state
