\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Project title}

\textbf{Full title:} \textit{UniServe: A Universal Service Management Platform for Reservation and Order-Based Businesses}

\textbf{Short title:} \textit{UniServe}


\textbf{Explanation:} "Uni" represents \emph{universal}, indicating the platform's flexibility across a variety of business models 
(reservation based businesses such as massage services or order based businesses such as restaurants). 
"Serve" refers to \emph{service}, emphasizing the platform’s role in providing core functionalities for these types of businesses.

\subsection{Problem statement}

Traditional methods of managing reservations and orders—such as handwritten
appointment books, paper or Excel-based inventory tracking, manual payment processing,
and physical order documentation—create significant operational bottlenecks that
directly impact business performance and stakeholder satisfaction. Reliance on
outdated manual processes for tracking orders, services, inventory, payments,
and taxes create several critical problems:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{For employees:} Manual order-taking and appointment booking
    requires constant memorization of availability, pricing, and menu
    details. Staff must repeatedly check excel/paper schedules or call to verify
    bookings, leading to errors, double-bookings, and frustrated
    customers. During peak periods (weekends, holidays, promotional events),
    employees become overwhelmed while simultaneously serving multiple customers, calculating totals, managing inventory, resulting in poor service quality and
    increased stress.

    \item \textbf{For customers:} Manual excel/paper-based systems create
    longer wait times as employees must record orders, search
    through paper/excel schedules, and handle multiple forms or cards during each transaction. Customers face a higher risk of lost or incorrect orders due to misreading, misplaced papers, as well as not noticed unavailable items, or staff miscommunication. The slower service caused by employees manually searching orders, calculating totals, processing
    appointments leads to customer frustration and
    dissatisfaction, especially during busy periods when manual
    workflows create bottlenecks.
    % \todocomment{ask PS design lecturer if users should be able to view that information or if the interface remains the same and simply the employees have access to that information}

    \item \textbf{For business owners:} Manual systems limit access to crucial business data, owners cannot easily track popular items, peak hours, or customer patterns. Inventory management and supply chain logistics relies on guesswork, leading to waste or stockouts. Tax management becomes complex and error-prone when relying on scattered paper receipts or fragmented Excel records. Without automated processes,
    businesses require more staff hours for administrative tasks that could be
    automated, increasing labor costs while limiting growth potential.
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\textbf{Technical barriers:}

Limited budgets and lack of technical expertise prevent these businesses from
developing in-house solutions as these solutions are often expensive and complex.

\textbf{Why this problem matters and consequences of inaction:}

% These manual processes directly limit how much revenue a business can generate.
% When employees spend time on paperwork instead of serving customers, the
% business serves fewer people and makes less money. The problem gets worse
% during busy periods when potential customers leave due to long wait times,
% representing direct lost sales. Over time, businesses using manual systems
% fall further behind competitors who adopted digital tools—they cannot match
% their speed, cannot reduce their costs, and cannot grow at the same rate.
% Without change, the gap widens: competitors continue improving their
% efficiency while manual-dependent businesses remain stuck with the same
% limitations, eventually losing market share and facing reduced profitability
% that threatens long-term viability.
Manual processes limit revenue by requiring employees to spend time on paperwork instead of serving customers, leading to longer wait times and lost sales during busy periods. Over time, businesses using manual systems fall behind competitors using advanced digital tools, unable to match their speed, reduce costs, or grow. Without change, this efficiency gap widens, decreasing market share and profitability.

% 5. Satisfaction

\textbf{Primary stakeholders:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Employees} expect a system that eliminates the need to
    memorize constantly changing information (availability, pricing, specials),
    allows calculating totals and managing inventory efficiently, reduces the
    risk of errors in bookings and order processing, and allows for a more
    satisfying and efficient customer serving experience.

    % need to memorize, provides quick access to changing information (item
    % availability, pricing, specials), automates calculations (discounts, split
    % bills, etc.), validates orders and bookings.}

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Secondary stakeholders:}
\begin{itemize}
    % o sitie primary? jie interactina su musu sistemos UI???? Jie interactina, bet pagal primary users apibrezima jie turetu intereactinti frequently, o owners ocasionally - tai secondary turetu buti manau
    \item \textbf{Client business owners} expect automated access to business
    data (sales patterns, inventory levels, customer analytics, tax information)
    that are error-free, reduced administrative overhead. They expect efficient
    systems that will reduce labor and allow them to focus on strategic
    decision-making and preserving historical records—to help identify trends,
    and boost overall profits.
    % not sure ar cia geriau, bet bandau kazkaip labiau specific kelis ir pateikti examples
    % \item \textcolor{gray}{\textbf{Client business owners} expect a system that
    % accelerates employee-managed orders and reservations, for example through
    % automatic validation or menu management (e.g., limiting options when items
    % are out of stock). They also expect actionable data—such as tracking sales,
    % payments, discounts, tips, and preserving historical records—to help
    % identify trends, improve inventory management, and boost overall profits.}
    
    \item \textbf{Customers} expect satisfying and efficient service with minimal wait times during ordering and booking. They expect their orders and appointments to be accurately recorded, with clear confirmations for bookings and orders. They expect to see available menu items in real time to make choices quickly.

    % \item \textcolor{gray}{\textbf{Customers} expect quick ordering and booking
    % with accurate records, and no inconveniences like being told later that an
    % item is unavailable or an appointment was entered incorrectly.}

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Indirect (tertiary) stakeholders:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{App business owners} recognize a market opportunity to serve
    underserved small and medium businesses that cannot afford or implement
    complex enterprise solutions. They want steady income growth by capturing
    market share from businesses currently using manual processes or considering
    expensive alternatives.
    % \item \textcolor{gray}{\textbf{App business owners} expect to capture market
    % share from small and medium businesses using manual tools (e.g., Excel) or
    % unable to use more advanced and expensive solutions (e.g., Toast POS). They
    % expect steady income growth by attracting these customers.}


\end{itemize}

\newpage
\textbf{Competitors:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Square
\begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{COMPETITOR ANALYSIS:}
        
        Square offers a free basic POS system with no monthly fees, appealing to
        small businesses starting out. However, Square charges per-transaction
        fees that accumulate for high-volume businesses. Users report that the Square SMS reminders for appointments feature is incomplete and unavailable for some plans.

        \item \textbf{OUR ADVANTAGES:} 
        
        Our flat-rate pricing model provides cost predictability for growing
        businesses without per-transaction fees. We offer SMS reminders for customer appointments for all plans.

    \end{itemize}
    

    \item {Toast POS}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  \textbf{COMPETITOR ANALYSIS:}
        Toast is a restaurant-specific system with strong
        features for food service operations. However, Toast requires significant
        upfront investment in proprietary hardware (costing €494-€1,034) and monthly
        software fees starting at €69 for advanced features. This pricing model
        puts it out of reach for many small restaurants operating on tight margins.
        Toast also requires technical staff to setup.

        \item  \textbf{OUR ADVANTAGES:} 
        We offer flat-rate pricing per plan with no upfront costs. Our simplified interface
        requires minimal training, allowing staff to start using the system
        immediately without dedicated technical support or lengthy onboarding
        processes.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Restaurant365
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{COMPETITOR ANALYSIS:}
        Restaurant365 provides comprehensive
        accounting and operations management with deep financial reporting
        capabilities. However, it starts at $90-$249 per location per month, making
        it expensive for single-location small businesses. The system is built for
        restaurant groups managing multiple locations and complex accounting needs,
        offering far more features than small businesses require. This complexity
        makes it difficult to learn and overkill for businesses that simply need
        basic order management and inventory tracking.

        \item \textbf{OUR ADVANTAGES:} 
        We focus on core operational needs(order taking,
        reservations, basic inventory) without expensive accounting modules that
        small businesses do not need. Our pricing is accessible for single-location
        businesses, and our simplified feature set means owners can understand and
        use the system without accounting expertise.
    \end{itemize}
    

    \item Excel: 
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{COMPETITOR ANALYSIS:}
        Many small businesses currently use Excel spreadsheets
        to manually track orders, inventory, and schedules. Excel is familiar and
        inexpensive, which explains its continued use. However, Excel requires
        businesses to build their own systems from scratch, offers no or minimal automation for
        repetitive tasks, and provides no real-time updates when multiple staff
        members need access. Data entry errors are common because everything must be
        typed manually, and there is no easy way to connect Excel directly to payment
        processing or customer-facing ordering systems.
        
        \item \textbf{OUR ADVANTAGES:} 
        We provide a ready-to-use system with built-in
        templates for common business operations, eliminating the need to build
        tracking systems from scratch. Our system automates repetitive tasks like
        inventory calculations and sales reporting, reduces data entry errors
        through dropdown menus, validation rules and automated calculations, and allows multiple staff
        members to access updated information in real-time. Our systems are also reliable and do not run on a single
        computer that can crash or be misplaced.
        \end{itemize}
        
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Development and maintenance team:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sysadmins} expect reliable system architecture that can handle
    varying loads (especially during peak business periods), scalable
    infrastructure to accommodate business growth, and clear deployment
    procedures to maintain system stability.
    \item \textbf{Tech support} expect comprehensive documentation and effective
    troubleshooting tools to efficiently resolve the types of issues small
    business users commonly encounter, along with manageable processes for user
    support that don't overwhelm limited support resources.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Current users' activities}

\subsubsubsection{Café Barista Managing Orders}
\label{subsubsubsec:barista-orders}

Marius, 21, works as a barista in a busy café. He takes orders at the counter
and writes them on sticky notes for the kitchen. During the morning rush, notes
sometimes fall to the floor or get smudged by spilled drinks. This leads to
wrong orders being prepared, which frustrates customers and wastes ingredients.
Marius tries to keep the counter tidy, but the lack of a structured system makes
mistakes inevitable and thus Marius spends extra time apologizing and remaking
orders, which slows down the queue.

% \yellowcomment{identify problems and opportunities, identify the problem in the story, go immediately to the essence of the problem}

\textbf{PROBLEMS:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Lost orders due to sticky notes falling or getting smudged
    \item Time and inventory assets wasted on remaking incorrect orders
\end{itemize}

\textbf{OPPORTUNITIES:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement a digital order management system to reduce reliance on sticky notes and minimize lost orders
\end{itemize}


\subsubsubsection{Salon Receptionist Controlling Bookings}
\label{subsubsubsec:salon-receptionist}

Lucille, a receptionist in her twenties, manages a constant stream of appointment calls at a busy beauty salon. She first records bookings by hand in a diary, then re‑enters them into a spreadsheet. On busy days, mistakes often occur, resulting in an average of 1 error per 6 bookings, such as double bookings. Rescheduling requires searching through the diary, which is time‑consuming and makes customers wait. 


\textbf{PROBLEMS:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item High risk of double bookings or missed appointments due to manual entry errors.
    \item Time wasted searching for original bookings in the paper diary.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{OPPORTUNITIES:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement a digital booking system to reduce manual entry errors and
    makes searching for bookings efficient.
\end{itemize}
% \todocomment{if we say that ppl write in excel we need to specify that as a competitor}


\subsubsubsection{Restaurant Manager Handling Discounts}
\label{subsubsubsec:restaurant-discounts}

Youmna, in her early twenties, manages a busy Lebanese restaurant. During weekday promotions, she manually checks eligible dishes (takes around 2–3 minutes per order) and calculates totals for each order (1–2 minutes), slowing service and sometimes causing errors or missed entries.

\textbf{PROBLEMS:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item High risk of incorrect discounts being applied due to manual calculations.
    \item Time wasted searching for eligible dishes on printed lists.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{OPPORTUNITIES:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement a system that automatically calculates totals and display, reducing errors and speeding up service.
    \item Provide quick access to eligible dishes for promotions, eliminating the need to search through printed lists.
\end{itemize}




\subsubsubsection{Bakery Tracking Inventory}
\label{subsubsubsec:bakery-inventory}

Thomas, 26, manages inventory at a small artisan bakery that recently adopted Restaurant365. The system requires multiple steps to log ingredient usage and current stock, making even simple tasks time-consuming and frustrating. Thomas doesn’t need all the advanced features, he simply needs to know when stock is low so he can reorder supplies efficiently.

\textbf{PROBLEMS:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Complex interface designed for enterprise needs creates confusion for simple daily tasks.
    \item Time wasted navigating unnecessary financial modules to complete basic inventory functions.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{OPPORTUNITIES:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item System updates inventory based on orders, allowing employees to see current stock levels and know when to reorder.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{PACT analysis of employees}
    \textbf{People:} Employees are mostly young to mid-career workers (baristas, receptionists, restaurant managers). They multitask under pressure, balancing customer interaction with operational tasks. Some are comfortable with smartphones and PCs. while other rely heavily on paper-based systems, showing varied levels of technical familiarity. They are motivated by efficiency: fewer errors and faster service lead to smoother operations and higher customer satisfaction. There are three types of employees: frontline employees (baristas, receptionists) who are constantly interacting with customers can often get frustrated dealing with plenty of paper orders that get lost or destroyed. Supervisors/managers oversee staff, they need better technology to make calculated decisions regarding discounts, handle exceptions etc. Support staff (kitchen staff, stylists) depend on accurate and timely information passed from the frontline, errors directly affect their output.
    

    \textbf{Activities:} Employees regularly take and manage orders or book and
    reschedule appointments throughout their shifts. They communicate with customers
    about availability, prices, and service options, often handling multiple
    requests simultaneously. These activities happen frequently with short
    durations, creating constant time pressure especially during peak hours. Tasks
    involve multiple steps (greeting, taking order, confirming, processing) where
    employees can pause between customers but must complete each transaction.
    Employees work both individually (appointment servicing) and coordinate with team members (kitchen staff), passing
    information verbally or through notes. The activities are moderately complex, including checking availability, applying discounts, managing inventory, processing payments, and handling customer communication. 
    
    \textbf{Context:} Employees work in a fast-paced, noisy and time-sensitive
environments, where they have constant interactions with both in-person and remote customers. Employees work in crowded spaces where handwritten notes can be damaged or lost. Constant phone calls and reliance on diaries make rescheduling time-consuming. Errors cascade into customer dissatisfaction, which consumes extra time and increase stress for staff.
    
    \textbf{Technologies:} Currently, employees rely mostly on paper-based systems (sticky notes, diaries, printed lists). While Point of Sale (POS) systems do exist, they are often underutilized or lack proper integration with bookings and promotions. In some businesses, Excel or spreadsheets act as makeshift digital tools, but these still require manual updates. In cafes, POS systems often only handle billing and do not integrate order-tracking, leading baristas to still use sticky notes. POS competitors may support discount application, but discounts must often be entered manually by staff, creating delays and errors. In other service-based fields, some competitors provide basic booking systems, but many lack real-time rescheduling features.

\subsubsubsection{Spa Client Booking an Appointment}
\label{subsubsubsec:spa-booking}

Ann, a student in her twenties, calls to book a spa appointment. She expects to receive a confirmation by SMS, but it never arrives, leaving her unsure whether her booking is valid. Deciding to go to the spa anyway, she finds it busy and has to wait. The receptionist, unable to quickly verify her booking, asks Ann to wait while they check. After a long delay, she is told that she is late and must reschedule. Frustrated by the confusion and wasted trip, Ann decides to try a different spa next time.

\textbf{PROBLEMS:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Inability to quickly verify bookings causes customer frustration.
    \item Lack of efficient communication results in wasted time for both customers and staff.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{OPPORTUNITIES:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement an SMS confirmation system to ensure customers receive booking confirmations.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection{Looking for a quick lunch}
\label{subsubsubsec:quick-lunch}

Annie, a 20‑year‑old university student, has only 30 minutes to eat during her break. She visits a small café and asks which dishes can be prepared within 20 minutes. The server doesn’t know and has to ask kitchen staff, causing a nearly 10‑minute wait. With little time left and limited options, Annie leaves and buys a takeaway wrap elsewhere.

\textbf{PROBLEMS:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Servers lack quick access to preparation time information, forcing them to leave customers waiting while checking with kitchen staff.
    \item Lost business opportunity as customers leave due to long wait times and limited options.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{OPPORTUNITIES:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Allow customers to see estimated preparation times for each meal, helping them choose options that fit their available time.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection{Item out of stock}
\label{subsubsubsec:item-out-of-stock}
Maya, a 22-year-old student, orders her favorite sandwich at a café, but the employee doesn’t immediately realize it’s out of stock. After several minutes, the shortage is noticed and alternatives are offered, leaving Maya frustrated.

\textbf{PROBLEMS:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Employees do not have real-time visibility of inventory, leading to delays in noticing out-of-stock items.  
    \item Customers experience frustration and wasted time when unavailable items are only discovered during order preparation.  
\end{itemize}

\textbf{OPPORTUNITIES:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement a system that shows available items to employees and customers.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection{Order with multiple variations}
\label{subsubsubsec:multiple-variations}

Lucas, a 26-year-old customer, places an order for a smoothie with multiple
variations at a café. The barista manually writes down the order without any
system validation for the variations. Later, the staff member preparing the
drinks notices conflicts in the requested options and asks Lucas to choose
different variations. This error reduces his trust in the staff’s ability to
process customized orders accurately and reliably.

\textbf{PROBLEMS:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Manual order entry leads to errors in processing customized orders.
    \item Lack of system validation for order variations causes confusion and delays.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{OPPORTUNITIES:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement a digital order system that validates customization options in real-time.
    \item Enhance customer trust by demonstrating reliable handling of complex orders.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{PACT analysis of customers}
% \todocomment{PACT is not very important for customers, they are not using the system as much as employees, so we can be more general here}

\textbf{People:} user group primarily consists of young adults in their early twenties, mostly students or young professionals with busy schedules and limited free time. They are generally physically capable, with no noted disabilities, and expect efficient, quick, and reliable service. Their cognitive abilities are strong — they can make quick decisions but have limited patience for uncertainty or delays. Most are intermediate technology users and they expect clear SMS messages, menu displays. Their motivation is driven by wanting to complete tasks (booking, ordering) quickly with minimal effort. Their mental model assumes that ordering and appointments will be done quickly with no errors from employee side. When these expectations are not met, customers get frustrated.
% gali buti ir prie activities kad stresa kelia

    \textbf{Activities:} Customers regularly order food and drinks or book
    appointments, trying to fit them into tight schedules like lunch breaks or
    between classes. They check availability, compare options, and communicate their
    preferences to staff, sometimes requesting customizations or asking about
    preparation times. These activities happen frequently throughout the day with
    short durations, typically just a few minutes per interaction. Time pressure is
    high when customers have limited break time or when queues form, requiring quick
    decisions and fast service. The process involves multiple steps (inquiring,
    choosing, ordering, waiting, confirming) where customers can pause but expect
    prompt responses at each stage. Customers act individually but depend on staff
    coordination to fulfill their requests accurately. Activities range from simple
    (ordering a regular item) to complex (customizing orders, checking multiple
    options), and errors are critical as they waste limited time, cause frustration,
    and may result in lost business.

\textbf{Context:} the primary environment is an indoor, on-premise service setting like a spa or café, which is typically busy and noisy. The social context involves individual customers interacting directly with staff to complete time-sensitive transactions. 

\textbf{Technologies:} When it comes to appontment based businesses there is a reliance on smartphones for phone calls or receiving SMS confirmations for appointments. The SMS message sensding is not automated, thus can be unreliable sometimes. For order based businesses there are no menu screens in restaurants or coffee shops for customers to be able to quickly see meal/cofe information.

\subsubsubsection{Restaurant Owner Handling Customer Feedback}
\label{subsubsubsec:owner-feedback}

Apolline, 39, owns a family restaurant in a popular tourist area. She values
customer reviews and wants to use them to improve service, but checking them
manually on different webistes(Google Reviews, Tripadvisor, etc.) is slow and complaints can go unnoticed for days. Without structured, easily accessible data, it’s difficult for her to identify recurring issues (for example, slow service during specific time frames) and respond quickly.

\textbf{PROBLEMS:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Manual checking of reviews across multiple platforms is time-consuming and complaints go unnoticed for extended periods.
    \item Lack of structured data prevents identification of recurring issues and patterns.
    \item Inability to respond quickly to customer feedback damages reputation and customer relationships.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{OPPORTUNITIES:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement a centralized feedback management system that aggregates reviews from multiple sources.
    \item Generate analytics to identify recurring issues and patterns in customer complaints.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection{Salon Owner Tracking Staff Performance}
\label{subsubsubsec:owner-staff-performance}

Nils, in his forties, runs a busy salon with six stylists. He manually records
stylist performance and client feedback in Excel spreadsheets. Mistakes in
typing or saving entries are frequent, and without a reliable system containing
accurate historical records, Nils cannot confidently track improvements or recognize top performers, which negatively affects overall team management.

\textbf{PROBLEMS:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Manual data entry in Excel spreadsheets leads to frequent typing and saving errors.
    \item Lack of reliable historical records prevents effective tracking of staff improvements.
    \item Inability to easily identify top performers undermines team motivation and management effectiveness.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{OPPORTUNITIES:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement an automated performance tracking system that reduces manual data entry errors.
    \item Provide reliable historical records with built-in reporting to easily track improvements over time.
    \item Enable data-driven recognition of top performers to improve team morale and management decisions.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection{Deli Owner Unable to Track Inventory Patterns}
\label{subsubsubsec:deli-inventory}

Hassan, 41, runs a single-location deli and tried to modernize inventory tracking using Toast POS. However, the system’s enterprise-level features, including multi-location dashboards and complex accounting modules, overwhelm him. After a month of not using the system, Hassan struggles to recall how to access key sales insights and basic inventory functions, making it difficult and frustrating.

\textbf{PROBLEMS:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Overly complex system hides essential insights needed for small business decisions.
    \item Time lost navigating irrelevant modules prevents effective inventory control.
    \item High costs add financial pressure without solving core operational needs.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{OPPORTUNITIES:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Provide simplified, insight-driven tools tailored for single-location operations.
    \item Focus on actionable sales and inventory data without enterprise-level complexity.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{PACT analysis of Client Business Owners}
    \textbf{People:} These are small to medium business owners, balancing
    managerial, operational, and customer service roles. Business owners’ can be
    different aged, thus they are all not equally technically advanced.
    Although they have limited time and often technical expertise, business
    owners are motivated by improving service quality, staying competitive, and
    reducing costs.

\textbf{Activities:} Business owners track staff performance, calculate wages
and commissions, monitor customer feedback, and analyze business metrics like
sales and peak periods. They make strategic decisions about promotions,
staffing, and operations while handling administrative tasks manually. These
activities vary in frequency: feedback monitoring happens daily, performance
tracking weekly or monthly, and strategic planning periodically. Time pressure
is moderate for routine tasks but can increase when dealing with budget
decisions. Activities involve multiple steps (collecting data, analyzing
patterns, making decisions, implementing changes) that can be paused and resumed
over days or weeks. Owners work individually but sometimes coordinate with
employees (inventory management). Complexity is high as activities are poorly
defined, requiring navigation between fragmented information sources
(spreadsheets, paper notes, review sites), and errors in data entry or analysis
are critical as they lead to poor business decisions and financial losses.

    \textbf{Context:} Business owners work in competitive environments, where
work often blends strategic step-by-step planning with hands-on problem solving.
The workplace of business owner is not only a desk in office, but they often
have to inspect the flow of business on site. Depending of the scale of business
they might have other employees working in the office with them, though it is
not the same everywhere. The ones with more employees have ability to leave some
of their work for assistants, while others have to balance traveling from
business meetings, office and their business place itself. Information is spread
across different informal channels, and the lack of structured data makes it
difficult to spot trends or train staff effectively. This work also comes with
social pressure from customers' expectations of professionalism and constant
improvement.
    % \noticecomment{organizational context - different permissions or same? Doesnt apply here, i think.}

    \textbf{Technologies:} Currently business owners rely on paper diaries,
manual notes and spreadsheets. Some business owners try using Toast POS, though
it is too expensive and technically difficult to be useful and they revert to
Excel even with its clear lack of capability for real time bookings etc. They
are also using external platforms such as Google Maps for
customer feedback. However, due to budget or complexity barriers, there is a
limited exposure to advanced digital solutions therefore, there are no dedicated
analytics dashboards or automated tracking systems.

\subsubsection{Needs of Client Business Owners}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[UN-11]\label{UN-11} A business owner needs to see customer reviews displayed in structured way from multiple websites (Google Reviews, Tripadvisor, etc.) so they can identify recurring issues and improve service quality.
    \item[UN-12]\label{UN-12} A business owner needs to receive notifications of negative reviews (below 3/5) from multiple websites (Google Reviews, Tripadvisor, etc.) so they can respond promptly and maintain customer satisfaction.
    \item[UN-13]\label{UN-13} A business owner needs to be able to see individual staff performance data, so they can recognize top performers, monitor improvements.
    \item[UN-14]\label{UN-14} A business owner needs to able to see sales data so they can quickly identify sales patterns and evaluate the impact of pricing strategies. 
    \item[UN-15]\label{UN-15} A business owner needs to see inventory stock levels so they can optimize ordering, reduce waste, and prevent stockouts.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Usability Objectives for Business Owners}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[OBJ-07]\label{OBJ-07} \textbf{Efficiency:} Owners should be able to access the required data (customer feedback, staff performance, inventory) within 1 minute.  
    \item[OBJ-08]\label{OBJ-08} \textbf{Memorability:} Owners who have not used the system for a month should be able to navigate to key dashboards with fewer than 5 clicks per task, without retraining.  
    \item[OBJ-09]\label{OBJ-09} \textbf{Satisfaction:} At least 90\% of business owners rate the system 4/5 or higher for enabling efficient analysis of sales and inventory data.

\end{figure}

The appointment creating from Square POS (\ref{fig:appointment-creation}) shows
customer information input table on the top, appointment details in the middle
and services at the bottom (there are also some extra features that we are not
interested in). It offers these important features for employees:

\begin{itemize}
    \item It allows for employees to see all the important information in one page, meaning that there is no need to have several pages open at once.
\end{itemize}

The only thing missing here is choosing the employee that the customer wants to be serviced by, but as the UI is structured in tables and rows clearly, it would be quite easy to add one more row below services for the employee to specify what employee the customer wants to be serviced by. 

We did not find any written user needs in this document that it satisfies.

It satisfies these \textbf{usability objectives:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \hyperref[OBJ-03]{OBJ-03} The clear UI with seperated tables for customer information, appointment details, services makes employee jobs more quicker and easier. As a result employee satisfaction rises.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \hyperref[UN-02]{UN-02} - It allows for the employee to see which slots are booked and which free.
    \item \hyperref[UN-04]{UN-04} - While not very clear at first as the search icon at the top of the image is quite small, employee can use it to search the bookings.
\end{itemize}

It satisfies these \textbf{usability objectives:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \hyperref[OBJ-02]{OBJ-02} The system forbids double booking, meaning that the only errors the employee can make are errors like imputing customer name or phone number wrongly.
    \item \hyperref[OBJ-03]{OBJ-03} The employee satisfaction increases as system prevents double bookings and furthermore the booking information in provided clearly in a slot based manner.

\section{Mockups}
\noticecomment{pirmas langas turi rodyti kaip apimti visus poreikius}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Wireframe 1 presents a high-level, visually-driven dashboard with a clean, minimalist interface. It prioritizes at-a-glance information and direct access to major management categories through a flat navigational structure.
    \item Wireframe 2 offers a detailed, data-dense interface designed for complex, multi-step management tasks. It utilizes a deep, hierarchical navigation system to organize a large number of specific features and sub-features.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implemented used needs}
\noticecomment{do both mockups actually implement these? what about manager needs? customer needs (live menu)?}
\noticecomment{mention how these needs are implemented... (you could reference the frame name in figma and then just write a little bit about it)}
% CASHIER (SER) (tikriausiai paprasciausias)

\todocomment{Find a nice way to seperate which ones are in both, which ones are in mockup 2}

\begin{itemize}
    \goodcomment{Added implementation for all UNs}
    \textbf{Employee Needs}

        \item[UN-01] An employee needs to record customer orders to avoid damaging them in the fast-paced restaurant. \\
        \textit{Implementation:} For wireframe 1,  \textbf{Order} frame, and For Wireframe 2, the \textbf{`Working / Order / Create`} and \textbf{`Working / Menu`} frames provide a digital interface for selecting items and creating an order.
        
        \item[UN-02] An employee needs to view available booking slots. \\
        \textit{Implementation:} (Only wireframe2) This is implemented in the \textbf{`Working / Appointments`} screen, which features a calendar-based schedule showing available and booked time slots for service-based businesses.
        
        \item[UN-04] An employee needs to search bookings by customer name to resolve customer queries during ongoing service. \\
        \textit{Implementation:} (Only wireframe2) Implemented within the \textbf{`Working / Appointments`} view, which includes a search bar to find appointments by customer.
        
        \item[UN-06] An employee needs to see the final total for each order, so that they do not have to calculate it manually. \\
        \textit{Implementation:} (Only wireframe2) Implemented in the "Check" panel within the \textbf{`Working / Order / Create`} frame. The system calculates and displays a running total as items are added.
        
        \item[UN-07] An employee needs to see current inventory levels automatically updated based on orders. \\
        \textit{Implementation:} (Only wireframe2) Implemented through the \textbf{`Working / Menu`}, which is designed to display real-time item availability based on inventory data.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Business Owner Needs}:

    \goodcomment{Added this section and list of UNs}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item [UN-13] A business owner needs to be able to see individual staff performance data, so they can recognize top performers and monitor improvements.\\ 
        \textit{Implementation:} Both wireframes include a section for managing employees (\textbf{`Your Team`} in Wireframe 1, \textbf{`Business / ... / Employees`} in Wireframe 2), which provides co-worker reviews.
        
        \item [UN-14] A business owner needs to be able to see sales data so they can quickly identify sales patterns and evaluate the impact of pricing strategies. \\
        \textit{Implementation:} Both mockups feature a dashboard with visual charts (e.g., \textbf{`Location earnings by quarters`} in the frame \textbf{`Owner homepage`} of Wireframe 1 , and the "Total Revenue" graph in the \textbf{`Business / ... / Reports`} frame of Wireframe 2) that allow owners to quickly see business performance.
        
        \item [UN-15] A business owner needs to see inventory stock levels so they can optimize ordering, reduce waste, and prevent stockouts. \\
        \textit{Implementation:} Both designs provide access to an inventory management section where owners can view and manage stock levels in the frame (\textbf{`Inventory levels`} of Wireframe 1, and \textbf{`Business / ... / Inventory`} in the Wireframe 2).
         \item [UN-NEW1] A business owner needs to create discounts(of multiple types) so that it could be applied to items or entire orders. \\
        \textit{Implementation:} Both designs provide access to an discount management section where owners can view and manage discounts in the frame (\textbf{`Discounts`} of Wireframe 1, and \textbf{`Business / ... / Discounts`} in Wireframe 2).
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Information architecture solutions}

% jei pasakome user centric tai pasakome kodel...

% mockup 2: hierarchine + pradzioje tiesine

The two wireframes intentionally use slightly different IA solutions to explore alternative user experiences.

\subsubsection{Type of Ontology}

\yellowcomment{Not sure how to highlight the difference without repeating what is written in 3.2.3}

\noticecomment{what are the differences between those wireframes?}
Both wireframes are based on a coarse-grained ontology. The information space is structured around a few high-level concepts: "Orders," "Teams" (or "Employees"), "Discounts," and "Business." These core objects are distinct and serve as containers for more detailed information and functions. 

\subsubsection{Design Approach}
\yellowcomment{Not sure how to highlight the difference without repeating what is written in 3.2.3}
\noticecomment{but if we are doing 2 different mockups there should be some differences in design approach too? or no?}

Both mockups utilize a Top-Down Design Approach. The architecture is designed from the highest level, anticipating the primary goals of the user (e.g., "I need to see create new discount" "I need to manage my staff"). The system is then broken down into logical subdivisions to support these goals.

\subsubsection{IA Structures}

\goodcomment{Updated based on all the comments}

\noticecomment{what are subcategories}
\noticecomment{What does very flat mean? Explain? 2 level or 3 level?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Wireframe 1: Employs a Hub and Spoke structure combined with a very flat, 2-level hierarchy. The "Home" screen acts as the central hub (Level 1), with spokes leading directly to the main management subcategories: Locations, Teams, Discounts \& offers, and More (which contains Inventory) at Level 2.
\noticecomment{You say its deep but you need to explain how deep.}
\noticecomment{deep is 3 level,  mention what category has 3 level depth}
    \item Wireframe 2: Is built on a deep hierarchical (tree) structure that is 3 levels deep. A persistent, nested side-menu organises functions into parent-child relationships. For example, a user navigates from Business (Level 1) -> Specific business (Level 2) -> Employees (Level 3).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Content Organization Schemes}
\goodcomment{Updated based on all the comments}

\noticecomment{How do we order things when lists open up? We probably wont order things randomly? For example in MIF website things are ordered chronologically. There are a lot of  lists , you should look into a few ones. If sth is first inputted then it should show up first.}
\noticecomment{Provide examples?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ordering of Lists: In both wireframes, lists such as inventory items or employee rosters are intended to be ordered chronologically by creation date by default (newest first), with options for alphabetical sorting to ensure predictability.
    \item Task-Based \& Topical: Both designs use a mix of these schemes.
    \item Audience-Specific: Wireframe 2 enforces an Audience-Specific classification at the very start through its linear onboarding process (Choose your roles). This provides access to a tailored interface. For example, a "Cashier" will see a different set of tools than a "Manager."
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Navigation patterns}
\goodcomment{Updated everything}
\noticecomment{look at the 7 slides to see how to name navigation patterns --- DONE}
\noticecomment{You should show the structure of navigation, or at least roughly do so (tell how things are nested) --- DONE}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Wireframe 1:} This design uses a combination of patterns to create a simple, direct user experience focused on high-level management.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Vertical Navigation:} The primary navigation is a \textbf{Sticky (Fixed) Vertical Navigation} bar on the left. This minimalist, icon-based pattern saves screen space while keeping main categories always accessible.
        \item \textbf{Hub and Spoke Structure:} The navigation is nested in a simple 2-level hierarchy. The vertical bar acts as the hub (Level 1), and clicking an icon (e.g., \textbf{Orders}) takes the user to the corresponding page (Level 2).
        \item \textbf{Cards:} The main dashboard content uses large, clickable Cards as a form of graphical navigation (e.g., "Orders", "Teams", "Discounts"). This allows for quick, visual access to the main functions.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Wireframe 2:} This prototype uses a more complex set of patterns to guide users through a deep, feature-rich application tailored to specific roles.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Wizard:} The user journey begins with a \textbf{Wizard} pattern for onboarding. This linear flow guides the user through the essential first step of selecting their role (e.g., "Business owner" or "Employee").
        \item \textbf{Vertical Navigation:} After onboarding, the core navigation is a detailed, text-based \textbf{Sticky (Fixed) Vertical Navigation} menu. This menu is hierarchical, allowing a large number of features to be organized logically.
        \item \textbf{Breadcrumbs:} To help users orient themselves within the deep hierarchy, the interface employs \textbf{Breadcrumbs}. For example, the path is clearly displayed as: \texttt{Business / My business for restau... / Employees / John Doe}.
        \item \textbf{Contextual Top Bar:} \noticecomment{The second wireframe also has app-bar but im not sure how to name it exactly --- DONE, described as Contextual Top Bar} The interface features a contextual top bar that changes based on the user's state. In "Working" mode, it displays role-specific information like \texttt{On Duty: Cashier} and the current location, providing immediate context.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Labeling System and Search Patterns}

\goodcomment{Updated everything}

\noticecomment{What about the first wireframe? Doesn't it use colors for labeling inventory status? What else?}
\noticecomment{If you say that we use icons, then show what icons we will use and name those icons, tell for what functionality those icons will be used...}
\noticecomment{search pattern in wireframe 2 has more functionallity, there are filters, commonly used filters have seperate drop down buttons}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Wireframe 1: The labelling system uses colour-coding for inventory status (e.g., Red for URGENT, Yellow for LOW, Green for OK) and for orders list (e.g., Blue for NEW, Yellow for In-progress and Green for Ready). The navigation relies on universally understood icons: a house icon for Home, a location pin icon for Locations, and a people icon for Teams, to facilitate quick recognition.
    \item Wireframe 2: Uses a more extensive labelling system with text labels and icons for sidebar links (e.g., "Working," "Appointments," "Services"). Its search pattern consists of filters with dropdown menus for criteria like "Job type" and "Location" to allow for more precise queries and also search field. The UI also reflects two distinct states: a "working" state with a task-oriented top bar and a "non-working" administrative state.
\end{itemize}

\noticecomment{States?? the second wire frame has two states: working and non working.}

Note: Not all breadcrumbs are active in Wireframe 2. Only the first few business frames (1–4) show working breadcrumb navigation. Use your browser’s back arrow to return to previous pages.

% mygtukai didesni ir t.t. Kokia turi buti darbo aplinka kad zmogus nepavargtu,
% nebutu broko, darbo vieta turi buti tokia kuri leistu islaikyti darbinguma.

% psihologinis erdviu suvokimas, kai kurie pasiklysta, kai kurie gerai
% orientuojasi erdvese. kalbos skirtumai, kai kam gali buti izeidzianti kalba,
% kai kam ne...

% isiminimas, trumpalaikis isiminimas, sprendimu priemimas, komunikacija,
% paieska - mes turime sias veiklas kurioms kuriame technologijas.

% socialiniai skirtumai - itakoja motyva pirkti nauja technologija, gali
% atsirasti stiprus motyvas, pvz bendrauti nuotoliniu budu, todel zmones ismoks
% tai. skirstosi tipai, begginer, inermediate, expert zmoniu. pvz bileteliu
% popieriniu nenupirksi, tai beggineriai turi tai naudoti... vidutiniskai patyre
% kai reikia tia naudoja o taip tai nenaudoja. profesionalai - kiekviena diena
% naudoja. beggineriu ir expertu poreikia yra labai skirtingi.

% kad pradedantysis galetu naudotis technologija tai ji turi vesti uz rankos,
% pvz vedlys, jis vedamas uz rankos.

% ekspertai - jiem reikia greicio, juos vedlys erzins.

% vidutiniskai patyre - reikia prisiminti greitai.

% jie visi turi skirtingus poreikius, reikia suprasti su kuo turime reikala.


% Mental model - mintinis modelis, koki vaizda suformavo vartotojas savo
% galvoje, mes bandome tai sufprasti, tai suvokimas kas ir kaip gali naudoti
% technologijas. Mintinis modelis nepilnas, nestabilus, mes negalime visko
% prisiminti, kazkas isilaiko ilgalaikeje atmintyje, kazkas dingsta.
% Analizuojame o ka dabar naudoja vartotojai, analizuojame ju mintines zinias.
% Mintinis modelis kuriamas saveikaujant su sistemomis, su kokiomis sistemomis
% saveikauja toki ir turesime mintini modeli.

% Nustatymas vartotojo igudzius yra musu tikslas. kokio amziaus, lytis, fizines,
% issilavinimas, kulturinis, motivacines galimybes, tikslai, asmenybe.
% Projektavimo tikslai turi susieti su tais skillais. musu tikslas kad
% vartotojai pilnai isnaudotu ka suprojektavome, norime kad is begginer greitai
% pereitu i intermediate.

% Pavyzdiziui kai pirma karta paleidziame programa, gali issokti gidas, padeti
% beginneriams, o kam nereikia tai gali uzdaryti, uzdaro vidutiniskai patyre.
% Ekspertam reikia kuo greiciau dirbti, kas stabdo (rankos kelimas nuo peles iki
% klaviaturos, galime sakyti kad viska darytu ant klaviaturos).

% kiek tu sluoksniu design reikia? tai papildomos islaidos ir t.t.


% begineriam programa turi pasakyti ka ji gali daryti, pagrindiniai dalykai ka
% ji daro, begineriu nera daug bet jie yra ir pirmi naudotojai todel jiems
% reikia viska paaiskinti. po keliu kartu dauguma begineriu tampa intermediate.
% intermediate svarbu matyti, isnaudoti visas funkcijas kurias jie zino kad yra,
% gebeti viska surasti, pazengusias funkcijas. GUI visas pagrindines ir
% pazengusias funkcijas rodo ir galima greitai surasti Ekspertu nera daug,
% kazkam galbut greiciau reikia.

% kuri viekla daznesne, ta turi buti arciau ekrano.


% Universal usability - prieinamas visiems, ir neigaliems. Panaudojamumas +
% prieinamumas = universalumas. kas aktualu, kam kuriame sistema, i sita turime
% atsakyti.



% Reikia pamineti demographics, age, occupation, gender (jei reikia),
% disabilities. Motyvacija ismokti technologijas, jomis naudotis. Naudojamos
% technologijos ir prietaisai, IT lygmuo, skillai.

% ____________________________

% Veiklos - reikia ne specifines mineti, o laiko aspektu daznas ar retas,
% bendradariavimo aspektus, individualus ar organizaciniai, tos veiklos
% sudetingumas, pasekmes, ar kritines, kokio tipo turinys toje veikloje.

% Daznis jos pirma charakteristika, jos trukme antra, laiko spaudimas, ar veikia
% ramybes busenoje ar skubos. Ar tai viena atomine veikla ar zingsniai yra, ar
% testine is zingsniu tai kazkuriame zingsnyje vartotojas gali sustoti. atsako
% laikas. Bendradarbiavimas, vienas ar grupeje, kaip zino kas ka padare, kaip
% koordinuoja, komunikuoja. Sudetingumas veiklos, ar veikla apibrezta ar ne,
% reikia suteikti vartotojui galimybe narsyti ivairias veiklas, kur vartotojas
% nori narsyti, kaip vartotojas supras ar nutrauke zingsni ir t.t. tai
% sudetingumas. kaip supras kad klaida padare, ar tai aktualu. kokie duomenys
% vaiksto, kiek ivesti ten reikia, kokia ten isvestis dabar ir kas siuloma, turi
% buti realiu laiku atnaujinamas turinys, kad nebutu blogai pavaizduotas, blogai
% atnaujintas.

% Ne pacios veiklos idomios bet ju charakteristikos.

% ____________________________

% Aplinka - fizine, kur vyksta ta veikla, patalpoje, uz patalpos, jeigu fizine
% aplinka lauke, tai skirtinga temperatura, kaip vartotojas su pirstinemis ar
% per lietu gali naudotis, apsvietimas, triuksmas ir t.t.

% Socialine aplinka - individuali, o gal grupine, ar privatumas aktualus, ar
% visi vienodu teisiu, ar yra super adminas.

%  Organizacinis kontekstas - teises ir t.t.

% ____________________________

% Technologijos - ka dabar naudoja zmones, kokias technologijas, ka jie dabar naudoja, tia itakoja ju mintini modeli, kaip jie dabar iveda informacija?

% Kokias technologijas naudosime - kompiuteris, programele telefone, ar t.t.

% Turime susivokti kokiu techniniu ir sistemu reikia. Kas yra geras turinys ir kokios charakteristikos galetu tobulinti tai, balsu ivedimas, AI ar whatever.

% kokia informacija ir funkcijos reikalingos sistemai, kas tures buti zinoma norinciam naudotis sitema.


% Interaktyvus produktas turi atitikti tai ko nori zmones, jis negali sugriauti kontekto, jis turi tai pagerinti.

% musu uzdavinys visus siuos dalykus issiaiskinti, parasyti kiekvienai pirminei ir antrinei vartotoju grupei aprasyti siuos dalykus ir po to dar kitai savaitei galime pradeti rasyti poreikius kas isto isplaukia ir kokiu funckiju riekia

% \sectionnonum{Results and conclusions}
% For details of what needs to be written in this section, please refer to the methodology requirements of the respective programme.


% ------------------------
% User Studies
% ------------------------

% Suvokimo procesas - nelabai gali issivaizduoti, projekte vyksta kuryba.
% Jeigu viskas patogu tai niekas nepastebi, jeigu kazkas nepatogu tai visi pastebi..

% Yra PACT sistema kuri apibendrina viska. Patys bendriausi reikalavimai yra
% vartotoju poreikiai, tai nevisai kaip reikalavimai. Poreikiai - ka vartotojas
% nuveiks, ka matys sistemoje.

% Vartotojau nori kad processas butu sklandus, intuityvus <- negeras aprasymas,
% ar cia bus mygtukas ar kazkas ekrane, cia yra labiau verslo lukesciai.



% Scenarijai turetu pateikti zingsnius kaip vartotojai dabar veikia, 
% what
% how
% any problems /\<- visa sita jau padarem

% ------------------------
% Koki tyrima darom
% yra kokybiniai ir kiekybiniai tyrimai
% kiekybiniai - apklausos, anketos, statistika, daug zmoniu, galime apibendrinti visai populiacijai, bet gauname mazai izvalgu
% kokybiniai - interviu, stebejimas, mazai zmoniu, gauname daug izvalgu, bet galime atsidurti klaidingoje situacijoje, negalime apibendrinti visai populiacijai


% kiekybiniams reikia didelio biudzeto.

% kiekybiniame tyrime suzinome nuostatas, problemas su laiku pradeda kartotis info.


% human centered design - suzinome prie ko zmones priprate ir atitinkamai
% kuriame technologijas. kokios veiklos daznos, retos, danzesnes veiklos
% pradiniame ekrane, retesnes kitame, etc.


% PERSONAS - isgrynina visas iskalbas kalbant su tam tikra vartotoju grupe.
% persona gaunama pakalbant bent su keliais atstovais is tos vartotoju grupes.
% persona yra konkretus atstovas skirtingu vartotoju grupiu.
% tikslai, prasmingos veiklos isskiriamos.


% zmones kurie daug zino ir kurie nenaudoja mainstream technologijas yra geras
% info saltinis. nereikia kalbeti su mainstream, uzkart galime suzinoti kas
% blogai su tuo mainstream. Gausime gera izvalga, kokie trukumai su ta
% mainstream technologija.



% 1 setting goals - atlikti PACT analize 

% 2 identifikuoti dalyvius, nuspresti is
% ko rinkti info (suinteresuotu analize jau atlikome), probability sampling
% (paimame atsitiktiniu budu zmones) arba non probability sampling (krastutiniu 
% grupiu). Saturation sampling - su visais kalbame kol nebelieka naujos info.

% 3 Relationship with participants - susitarti su vadovybe kad galime kalbinti
% zmones, virsininkas turi pristatyti kad bus toks tyrimas, etc. etc. Informed
% consent - pasiraso kad sutinka dalyvauti.

% 4 Triangulation - vienas info saltinis mazai, turi buti bent keli scenarijai,
% kad zinotume skirtingus poziurius, juos derintume.

% 5 Pilot studies - pabandome su vienu ar keliais zmonemis, kad pamatytume ar
% viskas ok, ar klausimai aiskus, ar suprantami.


% Interviews

% Pirma buna nestrukturizuoti, kuo toliau tuo labiau strukturuoti, tikslinames
% funkcionalumus, pozymius.

% semi strukturuoti - yra pagrindiniai klausimai, bet galima klausti ir papildomai

% group inteviesws - diskusijos, su keliais kalbam.

% vengti ilgu sakiniu, ar, ir, zargonu, vengti stumti i viena ar kita puse.

% fokuso grupe - atstovai is skirtingu grupiu, kai isriskeja skirtingi
% poziuriai. reikia kompromisiniu sprendimu.


% grafikai excel naudoti analizes metu, vaizduoti skirtumus etc...
