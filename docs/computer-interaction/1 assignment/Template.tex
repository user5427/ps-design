% \subsection*{Explanations}

% \textbf{The title page} contains:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item university name, faculty, and study program, \checkmark
%     \item project full title, \checkmark
%     \item contributors' names and surnames, \checkmark
%     \item year. \checkmark
% \end{itemize}

% \textbf{The table of contents} includes the sections and subsections until the 3rd level and page numbers. \checkmark

% \textbf{Project titles.} The project must have two titles: \checkmark
% \begin{itemize} 
%     \item full (e.g. ``Vilnius University Library App'') and \checkmark
%     \item short (e.g. ``Library''). \checkmark
% \end{itemize}

% The full title is used on the title page and in this section, a short title serves as a project reference in the document text and assignment file names. \checkmark

% \textbf{Problem statement} explains the high-level project goals shortly and
% specifically (about half a page). The problem is described in terms of user
% activities and situations where the problem occurs, and what aspects might be
% improved with a technical solution. Avoid describing or suggesting a solution at
% this stage that will hamper your design thinking when you start solving the
% problem. \checkmark

% To gather the relevant facts for your problem statement, you can use a simple
% technique called the 6 Ws, which involves answering the questions below: \checkmark
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Who is affected by the problem? \checkmark
%     \item What is the problem? \checkmark
%     \item Where does this problem occur? \checkmark
%     \item When does the problem occur? \checkmark
%     \item Why does the problem occur? \checkmark
%     \item Why is the problem important? \checkmark
% \end{itemize}

% \textbf{Expectations of the stakeholders} \checkmark

% Specify the specific groups of people (stakeholders) involved in activities that
% will be supported by your project (see Lecture 1. User-centered design).
% Identify relevant stakeholders' intentions that are supposed to be fulfilled. In
% the competitors subsection, you should list your closest competitors. Then you
% should list your main competitive advantages over them. \checkmark

% \textbf{Current user activities} \checkmark

% Watching how people do things is a great way to learn their goals and values,
% and come up with design insight. This is called user research. This assignment
% helps you train your eyes and ears to develop design ideas. Your goal is to
% uncover user needs, breakdowns, clever hacks, and opportunities for improvement.
% Begin by selecting a specific activity to observe. \checkmark

% The description contains the user story that tells about the current user
% activities. Note that your service or product does not exist yet. Therefore, you
% must describe the existing activities, such as how your users achieve their
% goals with existing competitive products, and highlight the pain points and
% troubles. Then, indicate the problems and improvement opportunities (see the
% assignment outline). \checkmark

% Describe at least 3 observations of current user activities for primary users,
% for the secondary – there can be fewer. Examples of activity descriptions: \checkmark

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Story 1:} Ann is a clerk in her twenties, comes for a quick
%     lunch. She wants to see dishes that are served within 15 min. She waits 10
%     min. for a waiter. The waiter says that only soup can be served in 15 min.
%     Therefore Ann leaves the restaurant and goes for a fast food nearby. \checkmark
    
%     \item \textbf{Story 2:} Andrew, a thirty-two-year-old restaurant client, who
%     suffers from allergies, comes to a restaurant. He examines the menu. The
%     menu is long, ingredients are mentioned in every dish. So, it takes about 5
%     minutes to choose a dish. Waiting for the dish takes 20 min. Andrew must
%     hurry and eats quickly because he has to return to work on time. \checkmark
    
%     \item \textbf{Story 3:} Thirty-five-years-old Peter goes to a restaurant
%     with his family. He noticed on Google Maps that a new restaurant was opening
%     not far away. They spend time reading the menu. The café has a children's
%     menu, but children's favorite dishes are missing. Children are bored because
%     of missing the game area. The family chooses quick dishes from the menu. \checkmark
    
%     \item \textbf{Story 4:} Fourty-year-old Sara comes with her friends to a
%     restaurant on Sunday. They are looking for a big table but see that the
%     restaurant is almost full. They started to explore the TripAdvisor app on
%     their phone for other restaurants phone numbers to ask whether they have a
%     free big table for a group. \ldots \checkmark
% \end{itemize}

% \textbf{How to check whether a story is correct?} \checkmark

% A story should cover
% characteristics of peoples, activities, environment and technologies that are
% related to computerized activities. If any characteristic is missing, you should
% augment the story. \checkmark

% \textbf{Needs statements and usability objectives} 
 
% After describing user stories, go over your findings. Brainstorm about both user
% needs and usability objectives. Observe the opportunities for design innovation
% that would improve the activity. User needs are formulated for primary and
% secondary users, only. Indirect stakeholders formulate business goals that are
% abstract and relate to business strategy. Business goals should be met with the
% needs of primary and secondary users. The impact of business goals on user needs
% is explained in Lecture 2, slides 52–53. Examples of usability goals and needs
% are provided in slides 54--57, and usability objectives are tackled in slides
% 58--60. 

% The project must contain at least 15 user needs. 3–5 usability objectives are
% defined for every user group. You are not looking for solutions yet: focus on
% user needs only. User needs and usability objectives must have unique
% identifiers. Below the needs and the usability objectives provide traceability
% matrices that link the need or objective identifier with the number of paragraph
% of the user story from which it is derived.

% \textbf{Inspiring user interface designs}

% Provide here examples of successful user interface solutions of existing
% software that can be useful for specified user needs and usability objectives.
% Provide a screenshot of the design, the number of user needs, or the usability
% objective for which this solution would be beneficial. Images should have
% captions with concise explanations and references to the source, from which this
% image is taken. The text related to the image should contain cross-reference to
% the image. Provide at least 5 examples.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Project title}

\textbf{Full title:} \textit{UniServe: A Universal Service Management Platform for Reservation and Order-Based Businesses}

\textbf{Short title:} \textit{UniServe}


\textbf{Explanation:} "Uni" represents \emph{universal}, indicating the platform's flexibility across a variety of business models 
(reservation based businesses such as massage services or order based businesses such as restaurants). 
"Serve" refers to \emph{service}, emphasizing the platform’s role in providing core functionalities for these types of businesses.

\subsection{Problem statement}

Traditional methods of managing reservations and orders—such as handwritten
appointment books, paper-based inventory tracking, manual payment processing,
and physical order documentation—create significant operational bottlenecks that
directly impact business performance and stakeholder satisfaction. Reliance on
outdated manual processes for tracking orders, services, inventory, payments,
and taxes create several critical problems:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{For employees:} Manual order-taking and appointment booking
    requires constant \textbf{memorization} of availability, pricing, and menu
    details. Staff must physically check excel/paper schedules or call to verify
    bookings, leading to \textbf{errors}, double-bookings, and frustrated
    customers. During peak periods (weekends, holidays, promotional events),
    employees become \textbf{overwhelmed} managing multiple phone lines while
    \textbf{simultaneously serving} in-person customers, \textbf{calculating
    totals}, \textbf{managing inventory}, resulting in poor service quality and
    increased stress.

    \item \textbf{For customers:} Manual excel/paper-based systems create
    \textbf{longer wait times} as employees must physically write orders, search
    through paper schedules, and handle multiple forms or cards during each
    transaction. Customers experience \textbf{increased likelihood} of lost or
    incorrect orders due to handwriting errors, misplaced papers, or
    miscommunication between staff members. The \textbf{slower service} caused
    by employees manually searching orders, calculating totals, processing
    appointments leads to customer \textbf{frustration} and
    \textbf{dissatisfaction}, especially during busy periods when paper-based
    workflows create bottlenecks.
    % \todocomment{ask PS design lecturer if users should be able to view that information or if the interface remains the same and simply the employees have access to that information}

    \item \textbf{For business owners:} Manual systems prevent access to crucial
    business data—owners \textbf{cannot easily} track popular items, peak hours,
    or customer patterns. Inventory management and supply chain logistics relies
    on \textbf{guesswork}, leading to waste or stockouts. \textbf{Tax
    management} becomes complicated and error-prone when relying on scattered
    paper receipts and handwritten records. Without automated processes,
    businesses require more staff hours for administrative tasks that could be
    automated, increasing labor costs while \textbf{limiting growth potential}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Technical barriers:}

Limited budgets and lack of technical expertise prevent these businesses from
developing in-house solutions as these solutions are often expensive and complex.

\textbf{Why this problem matters and consequences of inaction:}

These manual processes directly limit how much revenue a business can generate.
When employees spend time on paperwork instead of serving customers, the
business serves fewer people and makes less money. The problem gets worse
during busy periods when potential customers leave due to long wait times,
representing direct lost sales. Over time, businesses using manual systems
fall further behind competitors who adopted digital tools—they cannot match
their speed, cannot reduce their costs, and cannot grow at the same rate.
Without change, the gap widens: competitors continue improving their
efficiency while manual-dependent businesses remain stuck with the same
limitations, eventually losing market share and facing reduced profitability
that threatens long-term viability.

% 3. Memorability
% 4. Few and non-

% 5. Satisfaction

\textbf{Primary stakeholders:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Employees} expect a system that eliminates the need to
    memorize constantly changing information (availability, pricing, specials),
    allows calculating totals and managing inventory efficiently, reduces the
    risk of errors in bookings and order processing, and allows for a more
    satisfying and efficient customer serving experience.
    % \item \textcolor{gray}{\textbf{Employees} expect a system that removes the
    % need to memorize, provides quick access to changing information (item
    % availability, pricing, specials), automates calculations (discounts, split
    % bills, etc.), validates orders and bookings.}
    
    % \warningcomment{from lecture: "So, you don't need to think of self-service,
    % maybe like Burger King or McDonald's", "...you can assume that all business
    % operations are performed by business employees. So, you don't need to worry
    % that much about customer accounts..."}

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Secondary stakeholders:}
\begin{itemize}
    % o sitie primary? jie interactina su musu sistemos UI???? Jie interactina, bet pagal primary users apibrezima jie turetu intereactinti frequently, o owners ocasionally - tai secondary turetu buti manau
    \item \textbf{Client business owners} expect automated access to business
    data (sales patterns, inventory levels, customer analytics, tax information)
    that are error-free, reduced administrative overhead. They expect efficient
    systems that will reduce labor and allow them to focus on strategic
    decision-making and preserving historical records—to help identify trends,
    and boost overall profits.
    % not sure ar cia geriau, bet bandau kazkaip labiau specific kelis ir pateikti examples
    % \item \textcolor{gray}{\textbf{Client business owners} expect a system that
    % accelerates employee-managed orders and reservations, for example through
    % automatic validation or menu management (e.g., limiting options when items
    % are out of stock). They also expect actionable data—such as tracking sales,
    % payments, discounts, tips, and preserving historical records—to help
    % identify trends, improve inventory management, and boost overall profits.}
    
    \item \textbf{Customers} expect satisfying and efficient service with minimal wait times during ordering and booking. They expect their orders and appointments to be accurately recorded, with clear confirmations for bookings and orders. They expect to see available menu items in real time to make choices quickly.

    % \item \textcolor{gray}{\textbf{Customers} expect quick ordering and booking
    % with accurate records, and no inconveniences like being told later that an
    % item is unavailable or an appointment was entered incorrectly.}

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Indirect (tertiary) stakeholders:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{App business owners} recognize a market opportunity to serve
    underserved small and medium businesses that cannot afford or implement
    complex enterprise solutions. They want steady income growth by capturing
    market share from businesses currently using manual processes or considering
    expensive alternatives.
    % \item \textcolor{gray}{\textbf{App business owners} expect to capture market
    % share from small and medium businesses using manual tools (e.g., Excel) or
    % unable to use more advanced and expensive solutions (e.g., Toast POS). They
    % expect steady income growth by attracting these customers.}


\end{itemize}


\textbf{Competitors:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Square
\begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{COMPETITOR ANALYSIS:}
        
        Square offers a free basic POS system with no monthly fees, appealing to
        small businesses starting out. However, Square charges per-transaction
        fees that accumulate for high-volume businesses. Users report that the Square SMS reminders for appointments feature is incomplete and unavailable for some plans.

        \item \textbf{OUR ADVANTAGES:} 
        
        Our flat-rate pricing model provides cost predictability for growing
        businesses without per-transaction fees. We offer SMS reminders for customer appointments for all plans.

    \end{itemize}
    

    \item {Toast POS}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  \textbf{COMPETITOR ANALYSIS:}
        Toast is a restaurant-specific system with strong
        features for food service operations. However, Toast requires significant
        upfront investment in proprietary hardware (costing \$494-\$1,034) and monthly
        software fees starting at \$69 for advanced features. This pricing model
        puts it out of reach for many small restaurants operating on tight margins.
        Toast also requires technical staff to setup.

        \item  \textbf{OUR ADVANTAGES:} 
        We offer lower upfront costs by working with
        standard devices businesses may already own. Our simplified interface
        requires minimal training, allowing staff to start using the system
        immediately without dedicated technical support or lengthy onboarding
        processes.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Restaurant365
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{COMPETITOR ANALYSIS:}
        Restaurant365 provides comprehensive
        accounting and operations management with deep financial reporting
        capabilities. However, it starts at $90-$249 per location per month, making
        it expensive for single-location small businesses. The system is built for
        restaurant groups managing multiple locations and complex accounting needs,
        offering far more features than small businesses require. This complexity
        makes it difficult to learn and overkill for businesses that simply need
        basic order management and inventory tracking.

        \item \textbf{OUR ADVANTAGES:} 
        We focus on core operational needs—order taking,
        reservations, basic inventory—without expensive accounting modules that
        small businesses do not need. Our pricing is accessible for single-location
        businesses, and our simplified feature set means owners can understand and
        use the system without accounting expertise.
    \end{itemize}
    

    \item Excel: 
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{COMPETITOR ANALYSIS:}
        Many small businesses currently use Excel spreadsheets
        to manually track orders, inventory, and schedules. Excel is familiar and
        inexpensive, which explains its continued use. However, Excel requires
        businesses to build their own systems from scratch, offers no automation for
        repetitive tasks, and provides no real-time updates when multiple staff
        members need access. Data entry errors are common because everything must be
        typed manually, and there is no way to connect Excel directly to payment
        processing or customer-facing ordering systems.
        
        \item \textbf{OUR ADVANTAGES:} 
        We provide a ready-to-use system with built-in
        templates for common business operations, eliminating the need to build
        tracking systems from scratch. Our system automates repetitive tasks like
        inventory calculations and sales reporting, reduces data entry errors
        through dropdown menus and automated calculations, and allows multiple staff
        members to access updated information in real-time. Our systems are also reliable and do not run on a single
        computer that can crash or be misplaced.
        \end{itemize}
        
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Development and maintenance team:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sysadmins} expect reliable system architecture that can handle
    varying loads (especially during peak business periods), scalable
    infrastructure to accommodate business growth, and clear deployment
    procedures to maintain system stability.
    \item \textbf{Tech support} expect comprehensive documentation and effective
    troubleshooting tools to efficiently resolve the types of issues small
    business users commonly encounter, along with manageable processes for user
    support that don't overwhelm limited support resources.
\end{itemize}

Marius, 21, works as a barista in a busy café. He takes orders at the counter
and writes them on sticky notes for the kitchen. During the morning rush, notes
sometimes fall to the floor or get smudged by spilled drinks. This leads to
wrong orders being prepared, which frustrates customers and wastes ingredients.
Marius tries to keep the counter tidy, but the lack of a structured system makes
mistakes inevitable and thus Marius spends extra time apologizing and remaking
orders, which slows down the queue.

\subsubsubsection{Salon Receptionist Controlling Bookings}
\label{subsubsubsec:salon-receptionist}

Lucille, a receptionist in her twenties, manages a constant stream of appointment calls at a busy beauty salon. She first records bookings by hand in a diary, then re‑enters them into a spreadsheet. On busy days, mistakes often occur, resulting in an average of 1 error per 6 bookings, such as double bookings. Rescheduling requires searching through the diary, which is time‑consuming and makes customers wait. 
\textbf{PROBLEMS:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item High risk of double bookings or missed appointments due to manual entry errors.
    \item Time wasted searching for original bookings in the paper diary.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{OPPORTUNITIES:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement a digital booking system to reduce manual entry errors and

\label{subsubsubsec:restaurant-discounts}

Youmna, in her early twenties, manages a busy Lebanese restaurant. During weekday promotions, she manually checks eligible dishes (takes around 2–3 minutes per order) and calculates totals for each order (1–2 minutes), slowing service and sometimes causing errors or missed entries.

\textbf{PROBLEMS:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item High risk of incorrect discounts being applied due to manual calculations.
    \item Time wasted searching for eligible dishes on printed lists.

\subsubsection{PACT analysis of employees}
    \textbf{People:} Employees are mostly young to mid-career workers (baristas, receptionists, restaurant managers). They multitask under pressure, balancing customer interaction with operational tasks. Some are comfortable with smartphones and PCs. while other rely heavily on paper-based systems, showing varied levels of technical familiarity. They are motivated by efficiency: fewer errors and faster service lead to smoother operations and higher customer satisfaction. There are three types of employees: frontline employees (baristas, receptionists) who are constantly interacting with customers can often get frustrated dealing with plenty of paper orders that get lost or destroyed. Supervisors/managers oversee staff, they need better technology to make calculated decisions regarding discounts, handle exceptions etc. Support staff (kitchen staff, stylists) depend on accurate and timely information passed from the frontline, errors directly affect they output.
    

    \textbf{Activities:} Key repetitive activities are taking and managing orders or 
    booking and rescheduling appointments, all to make business as profitable as possible. It is necessary to communicate information to customers quickly, otherwise, employees have
    to resolve problems due to inadvertence. Regardless of their ranking, all employees try to do they job as efficiently as possible, using the tools they have. Activities require a high cognitive load due to memorizing availability, prices, etc. In this field, regular activities demand problem solving as it is one of the key characteristics of employees as they encounter a plethora of different situations every day.

    
    \textbf{Context:} Employees work in a fast-paced, noisy and time-sensitive
environments, where they have constant interactions with both in-person and remote customers. Employees work in crowded spaces where handwritten notes can be smudged or lost. Constant phone calls and reliance on diaries make rescheduling time-consuming. Errors cascade into customer dissatisfaction, which consumes extra time and increase stress for staff.
    
    \textbf{Technologies:} Currently, employees rely mostly on paper-based systems (sticky notes, diaries, printed lists). While Point of Sale (POS) systems do exist, they are often underutilized or lack proper integration with bookings and promotions. In some businesses, Excel or spreadsheets act as makeshift digital tools, but these still require manual updates and duplicate data entry. In cafes, POS systems often only handle billing and do not integrate order-tracking, leading baristas to still use sticky notes. POS competitors may support discount application, but discounts must often be entered manually by staff, creating delays and errors. In other service-based fields, some competitors provide basic booking systems, but many lack real-time rescheduling features.

Ann, a student in her twenties, calls to book a spa appointment. She expects to receive a confirmation by SMS, but it never arrives, leaving her unsure whether her booking is valid. Deciding to go to the spa anyway, she finds it busy and has to wait. The receptionist, unable to quickly verify her booking, asks Ann to wait while they check. After a long delay, she is told that she is late and must reschedule. Frustrated by the confusion and wasted trip, Ann decides to try a different spa next time.

\textbf{PROBLEMS:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Inability to quickly verify bookings causes customer frustration.

Annie, a 20‑year‑old university student, has only 30 minutes to eat during her break. She visits a small café and asks which dishes can be prepared within 20 minutes. The server doesn’t know and has to ask kitchen staff, causing a nearly 10‑minute wait. With little time left and limited options, Annie leaves and buys a takeaway wrap elsewhere.

\textbf{PROBLEMS:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Servers lack quick access to preparation time information, forcing them to leave customers waiting while checking with kitchen staff.
    \item Lost business opportunity as customers leave due to long wait times and limited options.

\textbf{PROBLEMS:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Employees do not have real-time visibility of inventory, leading to delays in noticing out-of-stock items.  
    \item Customers experience frustration and wasted time when unavailable items are only discovered during order preparation.

\subsubsection{PACT analysis of customers}
% \todocomment{PACT is not very important for customers, they are not using the system as much as employees, so we can be more general here}

\textbf{People:} There is a variety of different-aged customers with diverse digital literacy: younger users expect seamless mobile-first interactions, while older customers prefer phone bookings or real-life interactions. The pace of customers orders varies individually, some make quick decisions or can be more spontaneous, while others need to think for longer and weigh their options. There are customers with disabilities who need special accessibility using technologies or have other comfortable options to use the service.
% gali buti ir prie activities kad stresa kelia

\textbf{Activities:} Customers regularly order food and drinks or book appointments, often trying to fit them to their daily schedule. Customers choose their options by checking the promotions and offers, comparing availability, prices, and service quality. They are the ones interacting with the staff, and unclear communication lead to errors. Some situations require quick decision making especially when there are other customers waiting in line, thus creating pressure to think faster.

\textbf{Context:} Customers are in on-the-go environments, frequently interacting with the service during lunch breaks or between classes. They often have to stand in queues, call during office hours and wait for their orders/services. Some use the service after work hours so they might be tired, therefore they prefer cozy, relaxing conditions. Customers' expectations are shaped by competitors and broader digital experiences (food delivery apps, online booking platforms).

\textbf{Technologies:} There is a heavy reliance on smartphones and internet
access for convenience, though currently limited to phone calls, in-person
ordering, or static media posts. There are still no centralized, real-time
booking/order management systems for many small businesses. Customers expect
advanced digital systems with real-time availability updates, seamless discount
application and other features missing in manual systems.

Apolline, 39, owns a family restaurant in a popular tourist area. She values
customer reviews and wants to use them to improve service, but checking them
manually on different websites is slow and complaints can go unnoticed for days. Without structured, easily accessible data, it’s difficult for her to identify recurring issues (for example, slow service during specific time frames) and respond quickly.

\textbf{PROBLEMS:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Manual checking of reviews across multiple platforms is time-consuming and complaints go unnoticed for extended periods.

However, the system’s enterprise-level features, including multi-location dashboards and complex accounting modules, overwhelm him. After a month of not using the system, Hassan struggles to recall how to access key sales insights and basic inventory functions, making it difficult and frustrating.

\textbf{PROBLEMS:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Overly complex system hides essential insights needed for small business decisions.
    \item Time lost navigating irrelevant modules prevents effective inventory control.
    \item High costs add financial pressure without solving core operational needs.

\subsubsection{PACT analysis of Client Business Owners}
    \textbf{People:} These are small to medium business owners, balancing managerial, operational, and customer service roles. Business owners’ can be different aged, thus they are all not equally technically advanced.

Although they have limited time and often technical expertise, business

owners are motivated by improving service quality, staying competitive, and

reducing costs.

    \textbf{Activities:} Main activities consist of tracking staff performance
and calculating wages/commissions which are done weekly or monthly. Business owners also have to monitor and
respond to customer feedback which is often a repetitive daily task, and carefully manage business performance indicators
(sales, promotions, peak periods) that shape the direction of further work. The biggest hardships are making
strategic concentration required decisions based on incomplete/fragmented information and handling
administrative tasks manually without advanced technology.

    \textbf{Context:} Business owners work in competitive environments, where work often blends strategic step-by-step planning with hands-on problem solving. The workplace of business owner is not only a desk in office, but they often have to inspect the flow of business on site. Depending of the scale of business they might have other employees working in the office with them, though it is not the same everywhere. The ones with more employees have ability to leave some of their work for assistants, while others have to balance traveling from business meetings, office and their business place itself. 
Information is spread across different informal channels, and the lack of
structured data makes it difficult to spot trends or train staff
effectively. This work also comes with social pressure from customers'
expectations of professionalism and constant improvement.
    % \noticecomment{organizational context - different permissions or same? Doesnt apply here, i think.}

    \textbf{Technologies:} Currently business owners rely on paper diaries,
manual notes and spreadsheets. Some business owners try using Toast POS, though it is too expensive and technically difficult to be useful and they revert to Excel even with its clear lack of capability for real time bookings etc. They are also using external platforms such as
Google Maps, and TripAdvisor for customer feedback. However, due to budget
or complexity barriers, there is a limited exposure to advanced digital
solutions therefore, there are no dedicated analytics dashboards or
automated tracking systems.

    \href{https://squareup.com/help/us/en}{Source: Square — Help}
    \label{fig:appointment-creation}
\end{figure}

The appointment creating from Square POS (\ref{fig:appointment-creation}) offers these important features for employees:

\begin{itemize}
    \item It allows for employees to see all the important information in one page, meaning that there is no need to have several pages open at once.
\end{itemize}

The only thing missing here is choosing the employee that the customer wants to be serviced by, but as the UI is structured in tables and rows clearly, it would be quite easy to add one more row below services for the employee to specify what employee the customer wants to be serviced by. 

We did not find any written user needs in this document that it satisfies.

It satisfies these \textbf{usability objectives:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \hyperref[OBJ-03]{OBJ-03} The clear UI with seperated tables for customer information, appointment details, services makes employee jobs more quicker and easier. As a result employee satisfaction rises.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

The appointment viewing from Square POS (\ref{fig:appointment-list}) offers these important features for employees:

\begin{itemize}
    \item It allows for employees to quickly see what appointments are coming up and find appointments that need to be changed or canceled.
\end{itemize}

This user interface satisfies these \textbf{user needs:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \hyperref[UN-02]{UN-02} - It allows for the employee to see which slots are booked and which free.
    \item \hyperref[UN-04]{UN-04} - While not very clear at first as the search icon at the top of the image is quite small, employee can use it to search the bookings.
\end{itemize}

It satisfies these \textbf{usability objectives:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \hyperref[OBJ-02]{OBJ-02} The system forbids double booking, meaning that the only errors the employee can make are errors like imputing customer name or phone number wrongly.
    \item \hyperref[OBJ-03]{OBJ-03} The employee satisfaction increases as system prevents double bookings and furthermore the booking information in provided clearly in a slot based manner.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

The order menu from Square POS (\ref{fig:square-orders}) offers these important features for employees:

\begin{itemize}
    \item It allows for employees to quickly choose what the customer from menu wants.
    \item It shows the check simultaneously while new items are added so employee can inform the user what the discounts are available
\end{itemize}

This user interface satisfies these \textbf{user needs:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \hyperref[UN-01]{UN-01} - It allows for the employee to easily see what orders were added.
    \item \hyperref[UN-06]{UN-06} - The system calculates the total for the employee and also provides a detailed check so the employee does not need to do all that in their head or with a calculator.
\end{itemize}

It satisfies these \textbf{usability objectives:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \hyperref[OBJ-03]{OBJ-03} The UI allows the employee to simultaneously view menu and order details, reducing mental overhead and the need to memorize in turn increasing employee satisfaction.
\end{itemize}

    \href{https://smartersign.com/square}{Source: SmarterSign}
    \label{fig:square-menu}
\end{figure}

The live menu addon for Square POS (\ref{fig:square-menu}) offers these important features for customers:

\begin{itemize}
    \item It allows for customers to quickly check what is the price of the item they want, if it is available, and in what quantity it is served.
\end{itemize}

It does not show how long it will take to prepare these items but this information could easily be added.

This user interface satisfies these \textbf{user needs:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \hyperref[UN-09]{UN-09} - The menu allows the customer to seethe availability and preparation time of the meal they want.
    \item \hyperref[UN-10]{UN-10} - The menu clearly shows to the customer which meals are currently available.
\end{itemize}

It satisfies these \textbf{usability objectives:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \hyperref[OBJ-04]{OBJ-04} - The customers can quickly learn what is in stock so they do not need to ask employee or wait in line.
    \item \hyperref[OBJ-05]{OBJ-05} - The customers will be satisfied as they will be able to quickly make decisions.
    \item \hyperref[OBJ-06]{OBJ-06} - The customers will be able to quickly see how long their meal will take to make.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/examples/square_SMS.png}
    \caption{Square SMS messages}
    \href{https://squareup.com/help/us/en}{Source: Square — Help}
    \label{fig:square-sms}
\end{figure}

The SMS messages from Square POS (\ref{fig:square-sms}) while not being part of actual UI elements, still showcases that the text has to be clearly structured for the customer to quickly understand the purpose of the message. It offers to customer this information:

\begin{itemize}
    \item It asures the customer that their appointment was confirmed.
    \item It provides the time and the service name.
\end{itemize}


This SMS message satisfies these \textbf{user needs:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \hyperref[UN-08]{UN-08} - Customers can clearly see when if their appointment status.
\end{itemize}

It satisfies these \textbf{usability objectives:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \hyperref[OBJ-05]{OBJ-05} - We can expect that customer satisfaction will increase as they will feel well informed by the SMS messages.

% Naudojimo kontekstas - kaip veiklos itakoja technologiju kaita ir technologiju kaita veiklas, po to kalbesime apie pagrindines zmoniu charakteristikas, kas, kokiose veiklose ir problemas kurias norime spresti, kokiame zingsnyje kas ten stringa, kokioje aplinkoje ten vyksta, kokios tech naudojamos ir ka galime pasiulyti.
% Naudojimo kontekstas - kombinacija vartotoju, uzduociu, resursu, tikslu. Fizines, socialines, technines, kulturines, organizicines aplinkos. Jas riekes issaiskinti ir aprasyti kaip dabar veikia tas vartotojas, ka tie pasakojimai turi atspindeti: turi buti aiskus visi aspektai, kas, kokie tisklai, aplinkos, kokiais prietaisais, programomis naudojasi ir t.t.

% ekspertai - jiem reikia greicio, juos vedlys erzins.

% vidutiniskai patyre - reikia prisiminti greitai.

% jie visi turi skirtingus poreikius, reikia suprasti su kuo turime reikala.


% Mental model - mintinis modelis, koki vaizda suformavo vartotojas savo

% Suvokimo procesas - nelabai gali issivaizduoti, projekte vyksta kuryba.
% Jeigu viskas patogu tai niekas nepastebi, jeigu kazkas nepatogu tai visi pastebi..

% Yra PACT sistema kuri apibendrina viska. Patys bendriausi reikalavimai yra
% vartotoju poreikiai, tai nevisai kaip reikalavimai. Poreikiai - ka vartotojas
% nuveiks, ka matys sistemoje.

% Vartotojau nori kad processas butu sklandus, intuityvus <- negeras aprasymas,
% ar cia bus mygtukas ar kazkas ekrane, cia yra labiau verslo lukesciai.



% Scenarijai turetu pateikti zingsnius kaip vartotojai dabar veikia,

% any problems /\<- visa sita jau padarem

% ------------------------
% Koki tyrima darom
% yra kokybiniai ir kiekybiniai tyrimai
% kiekybiniai - apklausos, anketos, statistika, daug zmoniu, galime apibendrinti visai populiacijai, bet gauname mazai izvalgu
% kokybiniai - interviu, stebejimas, mazai zmoniu, gauname daug izvalgu, bet galime atsidurti klaidingoje situacijoje, negalime apibendrinti visai populiacijai


% kiekybiniams reikia didelio biudzeto.

% kiekybiniame tyrime suzinome nuostatas, problemas su laiku pradeda kartotis info.


% human centered design - suzinome prie ko zmones priprate ir atitinkamai
% kuriame technologijas. kokios veiklos daznos, retos, danzesnes veiklos
% pradiniame ekrane, retesnes kitame, etc.


% PERSONAS - isgrynina visas iskalbas kalbant su tam tikra vartotoju grupe.
% persona gaunama pakalbant bent su keliais atstovais is tos vartotoju grupes.
% persona yra konkretus atstovas skirtingu vartotoju grupiu.
% tikslai, prasmingos veiklos isskiriamos.


% zmones kurie daug zino ir kurie nenaudoja mainstream technologijas yra geras
% info saltinis. nereikia kalbeti su mainstream, uzkart galime suzinoti kas
% blogai su tuo mainstream. Gausime gera izvalga, kokie trukumai su ta

% 1 setting goals - atlikti PACT analize 

% 2 identifikuoti dalyvius, nuspresti is
% ko rinkti info (suinteresuotu analize jau atlikome), probability sampling
% (paimame atsitiktiniu budu zmones) arba non probability sampling (krastutiniu 
% grupiu). Saturation sampling - su visais kalbame kol nebelieka naujos info.

% 3 Relationship with participants - susitarti su vadovybe kad galime kalbinti
% zmones, virsininkas turi pristatyti kad bus toks tyrimas, etc. etc. Informed
% consent - pasiraso kad sutinka dalyvauti.

% 4 Triangulation - vienas info saltinis mazai, turi buti bent keli scenarijai,
% kad zinotume skirtingus poziurius, juos derintume.

% 5 Pilot studies - pabandome su vienu ar keliais zmonemis, kad pamatytume ar
