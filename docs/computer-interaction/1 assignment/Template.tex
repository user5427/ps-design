\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Project Title}

\textbf{Title:} UniServe

\textbf{Explanation:} "Uni" represents \emph{universal} inidicating the platform's flexibility across a variety of business models 
(reservation based businesses such as massage services or order based businesses such as restaurants). 
"Serve" refers to \emph{service}, emphasizing the platform’s role in providing core functionalities for these types of businesses.

\subsection{Problem statement}

\subsubsection{The background}

% Decades ago, it was still common to go to restaurants and expect menus to be
% handed out on-site, or to call by phone to register an appointment. However, as
% we move into an age of ever-accelerating communication and information exchange,
% these methods have become stubborn and slow. More customers and businesses recognize a need for
% faster communication and more accurate information exchange.

% Reliance on traditional methods slows down information exchange between
% employees, introduces human error, and creates friction in customer
% interactions. This leads to employee dissatisfaction, increased workload, as
% well as a decrease in operational efficiency.

% Slower communications and unstandardized registrations or menus introduce friction
% in customer interactions, makes customers more reluctant to engage with the
% business and leads to overall decrease in customer satisfaction.


\subsubsection{Impact on the business}

Owners of small to medium-sized businesses in the restaurant and beauty
industries often cannot afford the resources to develop and maintain a
specialized web application for managing their business operations and customer
interactions. This is due to many of these businesses having limited budgets and
technical expertise, which makes custom software solutions expensive.

The people affected by this problem include customers, who increasingly expect
online services such as remote ordering or appointment booking. This challenge
is common both in urban and suburban areas where internet use is high and the
contest for the attention and loyalty of customers has become a defining force.
Without an accessible digital platform, businesses risk missing potential
customers who rely on the internet for discovering and engaging with services,
leading to reduced customer reach. 

Furthermore, business owners also face operaqtional inefficiencies and lower
profits due to the lack of automation, requiring increased employee workload,
leading to increased recurring costs. The problem occurs continuously throughout
the year, but becomes critical during peak business periods such as holidays,
weekends, or promotional events.
