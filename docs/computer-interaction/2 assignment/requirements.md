# HCI course assignments

## 1. Class objectives

The course gives an overview of the knowledge and skills necessary for designing and evaluating the usability of interactive software. To achieve this, students come away with an understanding of:

* how to analyze and specify the context of use, user and task characteristics,
* user needs and usability objectives,
* wireframes and prototypes,
* usability evaluations and evaluation reports,
* work according to formal requirements,
* work together on a team project and communicate the work results in both oral and written form.

## 2. Assignments

Assignments are performed in teams of 3–5 students. Students create a project that consists of 5 assignments. Deadlines are provided in the VU Virtual Learning Environment. Each student has to contribute to analysis, design, and usability evaluations, which are documented in a written report and presented orally to the class.

During the semester, student teams perform 5 assignments:

1. user needs (exercise 5),
2. alternative wireframes (exercise 8),
3. usability testing (exercise 11),
4. high-fidelity prototype (exercise 14),
5. analytical evaluation (at the end of semester, exercise 16) – this is an individual assignment.

The Vilnius University Virtual Learning Environment provides exact deadlines and course materials.

Assignments must be presented orally, and the presentation takes about 15–20 min.

## 3. Documentation guidelines

### 3.1 The assignment document structure

The assignment document consists of the following parts: title page, table of contents, main part.

The **title page** contains:

* name of university, faculty, institute and study program,
* project full title,
* team members’ names and surnames,
* year.

The **table of contents** includes the sections until the 3rd level.

The **main part**. A structure of the main part is described in the requirements of specific assignments.

**Section numbering.** Headings of the sections have to be numbered strictly hierarchically. The sections have assigned numbers, such as `1.`, subsections – `1.1.`, `1.2`, subsubsections – `1.1.1.`, `1.1.2.` and so on.

**File naming requirements.** A file name contains a short project title, an assignment number and an assignment title. Example:

```
CarBuddy 1 User needs.pdf
```

## 4. Grading

Grading is determined by:

* project assignments (50%),
* final exam (40%),
* answers to lecture tests (5%),
* peers assignments reviews (5%).

Lecture tests can be answered during and directly after the lecture in the VLE.

Peer assignment review points can be gained by assessing the 1st and 2nd assignments. A review of peer deliverables is performed by filling out the form provided in the VU Virtual Learning Environment.

Each team member must participate in at least 3 assignments’ final presentations. Each additional absence will reduce the grade by 10%. The grade will be reduced for the late assignments: for 2 weeks by 10% and for 3 or more weeks by 20%. At least 3 completed assignments are required to be allowed to take an exam.

**Bonus points (additional 10%, the 11th point):**

* Participation during classes (7%), in a 10-point scale:

  * Attendance in the classroom (3 points)
  * Participation in the presentation of the homework or whole assignment (max 7 points)
* Declaration of team members’ contributions (3%).
