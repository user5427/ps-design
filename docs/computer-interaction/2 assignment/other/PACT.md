% We will use the \textbf{PACT} framework to analyze the needs of our system
% users. That means we will look into the people and their physical and mental
% capabilities, the characteristics of the activities they perform with current
% systems, context in which they perform these activities, and the technologies
% they use and which can improve their experience.


% \subsection{Primary Stakeholders PACT analysis}

% \subsubsection{Client Business Owners PACT analysis}

% Lets start with analyzing the \textbf{people} aspect of PACT. 

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Physical capabilities:} Client business owners can have
%     different physical capabilities, some of them might have visual or hearing
%     impairments. This means that our system must have different contrast modes,
%     font sizes, and support for screen readers.
%     \item \textbf{Mental capabilities:} Client business owners can have
%     different levels of technical expertise, mostly ranging from intermediate to
%     expert. We expect that they will be able to use sales tracking, inventory
%     management, and report generation features without much difficulty.
%     \item \textbf{Psychological capabilities:} Client business owners can be
%     from various cultural backgrounds and have different language preferences.
%     This means that our system must support multiple languages and be culturally
%     neutral.
% \end{itemize}

% Now lets analyze the \textbf{activities} aspect of PACT.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Temporal aspects:} Client business owners will use the system
%     daily, this means that the tasks like generating reports, tracking sales
%     will be easy to memorize. Furthermore these tasks should be efficient to
%     perform to avoid wasting time. Tasks like inventory management must be
%     error-free as they can place time pressure on the user during busy periods.
%     Furthermore this activity must be seperated into clear steps to avoid
%     confusion. It is also necessary to have real time update of inventory data
%     to avoid mistakes.
%     \item \textbf{Cooperation:} Client business owners will mostly use the
%     system individually, but they might need to share information with employees.
%     There should be a clear way to share information.

%     \end{center}


% \end{itemize}

% Now lets analyze the \textbf{context} aspect of PACT.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Physical context:} Client business owners will use the system
%     in a variety of physical contexts, including in their office, at home, or
%     on the go. This means that our system should work well on different screen
%     sizes and be responsive to different input methods (mouse, touch, keyboard).
%     \item \textbf{Social context:} Client business owners will need to have administrative
%     rights to manage employees and business operations. There should be a clear
%     way to manage user roles and permissions.
% \end{itemize}

% Now lets analyze the \textbf{technologies} aspect of PACT.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Technical capabilities:} Client business owners will have
%     access to various devices (desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones) and
%     operating systems (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android). Our system must be
%     compatible with these platforms and provide a consistent user experience.
%     \item \textbf{Software capabilities:} Client business owners may use
%     different software applications (CRM, ERP, Office Suite) alongside our
%     system. We should consider integration options and data exchange formats
%     (APIs, CSV, etc.) to facilitate smooth workflows.
%     \item \textbf{Network capabilities:} Client business owners will rely on
%     internet connectivity to access our system. We must ensure that our system
%     performs well under different network conditions (Wi-Fi, mobile data).

% \subsection{Primary Stakeholders Needs}


% Now that we know what are our primary and secondary stakeholders expectations,
% we can take a look into what are their needs in more detail. Specifically into
% how their needs will influence the design of our system.


% \subsubsection{Client Business Owners Needs}

% The main needs of the client business owners are to have a system where they 
% can manage their business operations daily, track sales, manage inventory,
% generate reports (taxes, profits, losses, etc.), and hire or fire employees.
% This need is driven by the fact that business owners need to have a clear overview of their
% business operations to make informed decisions and ensure the success of their
% business.



% The main needs of the client business owners are to have a system that is
% \textbf{error-free}, \textbf{reliable} and \textbf{efficient}. Business owners will need to use the system daily to manage their employees,
% track sales, manage inventory, and generate reports (taxes, profits, losses,
% etc.). Therefore the system must be error-free to ensure that critical data like
% report generation is not compromised. The system must also be reliable to ensure
% that business operations are not disrupted and that business owners can trust
% the system to perform as expected. Finally, the system must be efficient to
% ensure that business owners can quickly and easily perform their tasks without
% wasting time or effort for looking for features or navigating through complex
% menus.

% \subsubsection{Employees Needs}

% The main need of the employees is to have a system that helps them process orders,
% book appointments, and manage customer interactions. This need is driven by the
% fact that employees need to be able to perform their tasks quickly and accurately
% to ensure customer satisfaction and the smooth operation of the business.

% The main needs of the employees are to have a system that is \textbf{easy to
% learn}, \textbf{efficient} and \textbf{error-free}. Employees will need to use
% the system daily to process orders, book appointments, and manage customer
% interactions. Therefore the system must be easy to learn to ensure that
% employees can quickly adapt to the system and become proficient in its use. The
% system must also be efficient to ensure that employees can complete their tasks
% in a timely manner without unnecessary delays. Finally, the system must be
% error-free to ensure that employees can perform their tasks without costly mistakes
% or disruptions.

% \subsection{Secondary Stakeholders Needs}

% \subsubsection{Customers Needs}

% The main needs of the customers are to have a system that allows them to
% easily place orders or book appointments, view menus or services, and receive
% accurate information about the business. Moreover customers need easy to pay options. This need is driven by the fact that 
% customers expect a seamless and convenient experience when interacting with
% businesses, and a well-designed system can help meet these expectations.


% The main needs of the customers are to have a system that is \textbf{effective}, \textbf{efficient},
% \textbf{reliable} and \textbf{satisfying}. Customers will need to use the system
% occasionally to place orders or book appointments. Therefore the system must be
% effective to ensure that customers can easily find and use the features they
% need. The system must also be efficient to ensure that customers can complete
% their tasks quickly and without unnecessary delays. The system must be
% reliable to ensure that customers can trust the system to perform as expected
% and that their interactions with the business are not disrupted. Finally, the
% system must be satisfying to ensure that customers have a positive experience
% and are more likely to return to the business in the future.
