\subsection*{Decision-Making Approach}
Everyone is free to express their opinions, and the final decision is made by voting.

\section*{Team Rules}

\subsection*{Communication}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use one main channel on Discord
    \item Reply to messages promptly
    \item Be respectful and professional
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Meetings}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Attend all meetings if possible
    \item Give notice if not available
    \item Be prepared to update your teammates
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Code Standards}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use ESLint for linting
    \item Use Prettier for automatic code formatting
    \item Perform pull request reviews
    \item Follow additional agreed conventions
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Respect \& Accountability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Value everyone's ideas and contributions
    \item Share workload fairly
    \item Stay constructive
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Penalties}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Snack tax or beer tax
    \item Extra documentation duty
    \item Bug fix duty
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Key principles governing work distribution}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fairness and balance: Workload should be distributed so no one feels overburdened; try to balance difficulty, effort, and time commitment.
    \item Assign tasks according to strengths and preferences of team members.
    \item Be clear with responsibilities: Each task should have a designated owner and defined expectations.
    \item Track work using GitHub Projects; everyone should see what others are working on and provide regular progress updates.
    \item Avoid tasks that block other tasks; strive for parallel work whenever possible.
    \item Members are responsible for their assigned work, but must communicate and seek help if falling behind.
    \item Be willing to help each other; documentation and communication should allow someone else to pick up a task in progress.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Capacity Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each member reports weekly availability so tasks can be planned realistically.
    \item Hold a weekly sync on [FILL IN], plus short check-ins as needed.
    \item Track capacity: record planned hours versus actual hours spent.
    \item If a member cannot meet their capacity, they must inform the team promptly.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Tracking Progress}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use GitHub Projects to manage tasks and milestones
    \item Hold weekly meetings(Monday evenings) to review progress and plan next week.
\end{itemize}
